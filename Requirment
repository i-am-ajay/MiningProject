* Check previous day record at the time of insertion:
	if previous_day record is not available and previous_day is not less than date of creation, don't allow record insertion
	and ask user to insert previous day information. 
	At the time of previous day insertion again repeat the same process.
	
* At the time of posting, check if all the records exists within the current cycle, each machine will have cycle begin date
and cycle end date, if cycle end date is met then, update cycle count, cycle begin date and cycle end date in machine. 
Once we have cycle begining and end date make sure we have all the records with in the cycle.
